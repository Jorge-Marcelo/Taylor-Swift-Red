1 - State Of Grace
</h3>
<p class="content">
I’m walking fast through the traffic lights <br>
Busy streets and busy lives <br>
And all we know is touch and go <br>
We are alone with our changing minds <br>
We fall in love 'till it hurts or bleeds <br> <br> 
Or fades in time <br>

And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> <br>

You come around and the armor falls <br>
Pierce the room like a cannonball <br>
Now all we know is don’t let go <br>
We are alone just you and me <br>
Up in your room and our slates are clean <br>
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes <br> <br> 

So you were never a saint <br>
And I've loved in shades of wrong <br>
We learn to live with the pain <br>
Mosaic broken hearts <br>
But this love is brave and wild <br> <br> <

And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 

This is a state of grace <br>
This is a worthwhile fight <br>
Love is a ruthless game <br>
Unless you play it good and right <br>
These are the hands of fate <br>
You’re my Achilles heel <br>
This is the golden age of something good <br> 
And right and real <br> <br> 

And I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 

Oh, I never saw you coming <br>
And I’ll never be the same <br> <br> 

This is a state of grace <br>
This is a worthwhile fight <br>
Love is a ruthless game <br>
Unless you play it good and right <br>

2 - Red
</h3>
<p class="content">
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati <br>
Down a dead-end street <br>
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin <br>
Ending so suddenly <br> <br>

Loving him is like trying to change your mind <br>
Once you’re already flying through the free fall <br>
Like the colours in autumn, so bright <br>
Just before they lose it all <br> <br>

Losing him was blue, like I’d never known <br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met <br>
But loving him was red <br>
Loving him was red <br> <br>

Touching him was like realising all you ever wanted <br>
Was right there in front of you <br>
Memorising him was as easy as knowing all the words <br>
To your old favourite song <br> <br>

Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword <br>
And realising there’s no right answer <br>
Regretting him was like wishing you’d never found out <br>
That love could be that strong <br> <br>

Losing him was blue, like I’d never known <br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met <br>
But loving him was red <br>
Oh, red <br>
Burning red <br> <br>

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes <br>
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go <br>
But moving on from him is impossible <br>
When I still see it all in my head <br>
In burning red <br> <br>

Burning, it was red <br> <br>

Oh, losing him was blue, like I’d never known <br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone <br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you’ve never met <br>
‘Cause loving him was red <br>
Yeah, yeah, red <br>
Oh, burning red <br> <br>

And that’s why he’s spinning ‘round in my head <br>
Comes back to me burning red <br>
Yeah, yeah <br> <br>

His love was like driving a new Maserati <br>
Down a dead-end street <br> <br>

3 - Treacherous	
</h3>
<p class="content">
Put your lips close to mine<br>
As long as they don't touch <br>
Out of focus, eye to eye <br>
'Till the gravity’s too much <br>
And I'll do anything you say <br>
If you say it with your hands <br>
And I'd be smart to walk away <br>
But you're quicksand <br> <br>

This slope is treacherous <br>
This path is reckless <br>
This slope is treacherous <br>
And I, I, I like it <br> <br>

I can't decide if it's a choice <br>
Getting swept away <br>
I hear the sound of my own voice <br>
Asking you to stay <br>
And all we are is skin and bone <br>
Trained to get along <br>
Forever going with the flow <br>
But you're friction <br> <br>

This slope is treacherous <br>
This path is reckless <br>
This slope is treacherous <br>
I, I, I like it <br> <br>

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night <br>
And I will get you a, get you alone <br>
Your name has echoed through my mind <br>
And I just think you should, think you should know <br>
That nothing safe is worth the drive <br>
And I would follow you, follow you home <br>
I'll follow you, follow you home <br> <br>

This hope is treacherous <br>
This daydream is dangerous <br>
This hope is treacherous <br>
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I <br> <br>

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night <br>
And I will get you a, get you alone <br>
Your name has echoed through my mind <br>
And I just think you should, think you should know <br>
That nothing safe is worth the drive <br>
And I would follow you, follow you home <br>
I'll follow you, follow you home <br>
I'll follow you, follow you home <br>
I'll follow you, follow you home <br> <br>

I, I, I like it

4 - I Knew You Were Trouble
</h3>
<p class="content">
Once upon time, a few mistakes ago <br>
I was in your sights, you got me alone <br>
You found me, you found me, you found me <br>
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that <br>
And when I fell hard, you took a step back <br>
Without me, without me, without me <br> <br>

And he's long gone, when he's next to me <br>
And I realize the blame is on me <br> <br>

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
'Till you put me down <br>
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground <br> <br>

Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br>
Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br> <br>

No apologies, he'll never see you cry <br> 
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why <br>
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning <br> 
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street <br>
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be <br>
And now I see, now I see, now I see <br> <br>

He was long gone, when he met me <br>
And I realize the joke is on me, hey <br> <br>

I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br> 
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
'Till you put me down <br>
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground <br> <br>

Oh, oh <br> 
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br>
Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br> <br>

And the saddest fear <br> 
Comes creeping in <br>
That you never loved me <br>
Or her, or anyone, or anything <br> 
Yeah! <br> <br>

I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
'Till you put me down <br>
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>
So shame on me now <br>
Flew me to places I'd never been <br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground <br> <br>

Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br>
Oh, oh <br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br> 
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br> 
Trouble, trouble, trouble <br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in <br>

5 - All Too Well
</h3>
<p class="content">
 I walked through the door with you, the air was cold <br>
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow <br>
And I, left my scarf there, at your sister's house <br>
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now <br> <br>

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze <br>
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate <br>
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place <br>
And I can picture it after all these days <br> <br>

And I know it's long gone <br>
And that magic's not here no more <br>
And I might be okay <br>
But I'm not fine at all <br> <br>

'Cause there we are again on that little town street <br>
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me <br>
Wind in my hair, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red <br>
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed <br>
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the Tee-ball team <br>
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me <br> <br>

And I know it's long gone <br>
And there was nothing else I could do <br>
And I forget about you long enough <br>
To forget why I needed to <br> <br>

'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night <br>
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light <br>
Down the stairs, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>

And maybe we got lost in translation <br>
Maybe I asked for too much <br>
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up <br>
Running scared, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise <br>
So casually cruel in the name of being honest <br>
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here <br>
'Cause I remember it all, all, all <br> 
Too well <br> <br>

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralysed by it <br>
I'd like to be my old self again <br>
But I'm still trying to find it <br>
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own <br>
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone <br> <br>

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week <br>
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me <br>
You can't get rid of it <br>
'Cause you remember it all too well <br> <br>

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so <br> 
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known <br>
It was rare, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>

Wind in my hair, you were there <br>
You remember it all <br>
Down the stairs, you were there <br>
You remember it all <br>
It was rare, I was there <br>
I remember it all too well <br> <br>

It feels like a perfect night <br>
To dress up like hipsters <br>
And make fun of our exes, ah, ah, ah, ah <br>
It feels like a perfect night <br>
For breakfast at midnight <br>
To fall in love with strangers, ah, ah, ah, ah <br> <br>

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time <br>
It's miserable and magical <br>
Oh, yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines <br>
It's time, oh, oh <br> <br>

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22 <br>
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you <br>
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to <br>
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22 <br> <br>

It seems like one of those nights <br>
This place is too crowded <br>
Too many cool kids, ah, ah, ah, ah <br>
It seems like one of those nights <br>
We ditch the whole scene <br>
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping <br> <br>

Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way <br>

Oh, yeah, tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks <br>

I bet you’re tired from a long hard week <br>
I bet you’re sittin’ in your chair by the window <br>
Looking out at the city <br>

And I just want to tell you <br>
It takes everything in me not to call you <br>
And I wish I could run to you <br>
And I hope you know that everytime I don’t <br>

8 - We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
</h3>
<p class="content">
I remember when we broke up, the first time<br>
Saying: This is it, I’ve had enough! ‘Cause, like <br>
We hadn’t seen each other in a month <br>
When you said you needed space (what?) <br> <br>

Then you come around again and say: Baby <br>
I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me <br>
Remember how that lasted for a day? <br>
I say: I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you <br> <br>

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
We called it off again last night, but <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you <br> <br>

We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
You go talk to your friends <br>
Talk to my friends, talk to me <br>
But we are never, ever, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br> <br>

Like, ever! <br> <br>

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights, and me <br>
Falling for it, screaming that I'm right, and you <br>
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some <br>
Indie record that’s much cooler than mine <br> <br>

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
You called me up again tonight, but <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you <br> <br>

We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
You go talk to your friends <br>
Talk to my friends, talk to me <br>
But we are never, ever, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br> <br>

Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah <br>
Ooh, yeah, oh, oh, oh <br> <br>

I used to think that we were forever, ever <br>
And I used to say: Never say never <br> <br>

Ugh, so he calls me up and he’s like: I still love you <br>
And I'm like, I'm just <br>
Yeah, I mean, this is exhausting, you know? <br>
Like, we are never getting back together <br> 
Like, ever! <br>
No <br> <br>

We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
We are never, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br>
You go talk to your friends <br>
Talk to my friends, talk to me <br>
But we are never, ever, ever, ever <br>
Getting back together <br> <br>

(We) getting back together (ooh, ooh, ooh) <br>
(We) getting back together (ooh, ooh, ooh) <br>

9 - Stay Stay Stay	
</h3>
<p class="content">
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night <br>
I threw my phone across the room, at you <br>
I was expecting some dramatic turn away <br>
But you stayed <br> <br>

This morning I said we should talk about it <br>
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved <br>
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet <br>
And said: Okay, let's talk! <br>
And I said <br> <br>

Stay, stay, stay <br>
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br>
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br>
But I think that it's best if we both stay <br> <br>

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers <br>
Who took all of their problems out on me <br>
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughing <br>
And I love you because you have given me <br>
No choice but to <br> <br>

Stay, stay, stay <br>
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br>
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br>
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay <br> <br>

You took the time to memorize me <br>
My fears, my hopes and dreams <br>
I just like hanging out with you <br>
All the time <br>
All those times that you didn't leave <br>
It's been occurring to me <br>
I'd like to hang out with you <br>
For my whole life <br> <br>

Stay <br>
And I'll be loving you for quite some time <br>
No one else is gonna love me <br>
When I get mad, mad, mad <br>
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay <br>

Stay, stay, stay <br>
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time <br>
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad <br>
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay <br>
Stay, stay, stay <br> <br>

I find myself at your door <br>
Just like all those times before <br>
I’m not sure how I got  <br>
All roads, they lead me here <br>
I imagine you are home <br>
In your room, all alone <br>
And you open your eyes into mine <br>
And everything feels better <br> <br>

And right before your eyes <br>
I’m breaking <br>
No past, no reasons why <br>
Just you and me <br> <br>

This is the last time I’m asking you this <br>
Put my name at the top of your list <br>
This is the last time I’m asking you why <br>
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye <br> <br>

You find yourself at my door <br>
Just like all those times before <br>
You wear your best apology <br>
But I was there to watch you leave <br>
And all the times I let you in <br>
Just for you to go again <br>
Disappear when you come back <br>
Everything is better <br> <br>

And right before your eyes <br>
I’m aching <br>
No past, nowhere to hide <br>
Just you and me <br> <br>

This is the last time I’m asking you this <br>
Put my name at the top of your list <br>
This is the last time I’m asking you why <br>
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye <br> <br>

This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong <br>
This is the last time I say: It’s been you all along <br>
This is the last time I let you in my door <br>
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore <br> <br>

This is the last time I’m asking you this <br>

 11 - Holy Ground   
 </h3>   
</div>

<div align="center">
<p class="content">
I was reminiscing just the other day <br>
While having coffee all alone, and, Lord, it took me away <br>
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time <br>
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme <br>
Took off faster than a green light, go <br>
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know <br>
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made <br>
And that was the first day <br> <br>

And, darling, it was good <br>
Never looking down <br>
And right there where we stood <br>
Was holy ground <br> <br>

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress <br>
We had this big wide city all to ourselves <br>
We block the noise with the sound of 'I need you' <br>
And for the first time I had something to lose <br>
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way <br>
And the story’s got dust on every page <br>
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now <br>
And I see your face in every crowd <br> <br>

'Cause, darling, it was good <br>
Never looking down <br>
And right there where we stood <br>
Was holy ground <br> <br>

Tonight I'm gonna dance <br>
For all that we've been through <br>
But I don't want to dance <br>
If I'm not dancing with you <br>
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br>
Like you were in this room <br>
But I don't want to dance <br>
If I'm not dancing with you <br> <br>

It was good <br>
Never looking down <br>
And right there where we stood <br>
Was holy ground <br> <br>

Tonight I'm gonna dance <br>
For all that we've been through <br>
But I don't want to dance <br>
If I'm not dancing with you <br>
Tonight I'm gonna dance <br>
Like you were in this room <br>
But I don't want to dance <br>
If I'm not dancing with you

<div align="center">
<p class="content">
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket <br>
Words, how little they mean when you’re a little too late <br>
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket <br>
Good girls, hopeful they’ll be and long they will wait <br> <br>

We had a beautiful, magic love there <br>
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair <br> <br>

In dreams, I meet you in long conversation <br>
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities <br>
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you <br>
And you’ve got your demons, and darling, they all look like me <br> <br>

‘Cause we had a beautiful, magic love there <br>
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair <br> <br>

Distance, timing <br>
Breakdown, fighting <br>
Silence, the train runs of its tracks <br>
Kiss me, try to fix it <br>
Could you just try to listen? <br> 
Hang up, give up <br>
And for the life of us we can’t get back <br> <br>

A beautiful, magic love there <br>
What a sad, beautiful, tragic... <br>
Beautiful, tragic... <br>
Beautiful... <br> <br>

What we had - a beautiful, magic love there <br>
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair <br> <br>

What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

 New to town with a made up name <br>
In the angel's city chasing fortune and fame <br>
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream <br>
You had it figured out since you were in school <br>
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool <br>
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen <br> <br>

Another name goes up in lights <br>
Like diamonds in the sky <br> <br>

And they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one? <br> 
Oh, oh, oh <br> <br>

Now it's big black cars and Riviera views <br>
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you <br>
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page <br>
And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused <br>
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used <br>
And all the young things line up to take your place <br> <br>

Another name goes up in lights <br>
You wonder if you'll make it out alive <br> <br>

And they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one? <br>
Oh, oh, oh <br> <br>

It was a few years later I showed up here <br>
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared <br>
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out <br>
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere <br>
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square <br>
And it took some time, but I understand it now <br> <br>

'Cause now my name is up in lights <br>
But I think you got it right <br> <br>

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one <br>
Oh, oh, oh <br> <br>

All I knew this morning when I woke <br>
Is I know something now, know something now <br>
I didn't before <br>
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago <br>
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile <br>
In the back of my mind, making me feel like <br> <br>

I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you better, know you better <br>

'Cause all I know is we said hello <br>
And your eyes look like coming home <br>
All I know is a simple name <br>
And everything has changed <br>
All I know is you held the door <br>
You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br>
All I know since yesterday <br>
Is everything has changed <br> <br>

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue <br>
Well, I'll take 'em down, take 'em down <br>
And open up the door for you <br>
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies <br>
The beautiful kind making up for lost time <br>
Taking flight, making me feel like <br> <br>

I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time <br>
And meet me there tonight <br>
And let me know that it's not all in my mind <br> <br>

I just want to know you better, know you better <br>
Know you better now <br>
I just want to know you, know you, know you <br> <br>

All I know is we said hello <br>
Your eyes look like coming home <br>
All I know is a simple name <br>
And everything has changed <br>
All I know is you held the door <br>
You'll be mine and I'll be yours <br>
All I know since yesterday <br>
Is everything has changed <br> <br>

All I know is we said hello <br>
So dust off your highest hopes <br> 
All I know is pouring rain <br>
And everything has changed <br>
All I know is a newfound grace <br>
All my days I'll know your face <br>
All I know since yesterday <br>
Is everything has changed

I said: Oh my, what a marvellous tune <br>
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved <br>
The whole place was dressed to the nines <br>
And we were dancing, dancing <br>
Like we're made of starlight <br>
Like we're made of starlight <br> <br>

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45 <br>
Picked me up late one night out the window <br>
We were 17 and crazy, runnin' wild, wild <br>
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in <br>
The night we snuck into a yacht club party <br>
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince <br> <br>

And I said: Oh my, what a marvellous tune <br>
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved <br>
The whole place was dressed to the nines <br>
And we were dancing, dancing <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br> <br>

He said: Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change <br>
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues <br>
If you keep thinking that way <br>
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me <br>
Don't you see the starlight, starlight? <br>
Don't you dream impossible things? <br> <br>

Like, oh my, what a marvellous tune <br>
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved <br>
The whole place was dressed to the nines <br>
And we were dancing, dancing <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br>
Like we're made of starlight, starlight <br> <br>

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy <br>
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me <br>
Ooh, ooh, we could get married <br>
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream <br> <br>

Hoo, hoo, hoo <br>
Hoo, hoo, hoo <br>
Hoo, hoo, hoo <br>

Took a deep breath in the mirror <br>
He didn't like it when I wore high heels <br>
But I do <br>
Turn the lock and put my headphones on <br>
He always said he didn't get this song <br>
But I do, I do <br> <br>

I walked in expecting you'd be late <br>
But you got here early and you stand and wave <br>
I walk to you <br>
You pull my chair out and help me in <br>
And you don't know how nice that is <br> 
But I do <br> <br>

And you throw your head back laughing <br>
Like a little kid <br>
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny <br>
'Cause he never did <br>
And I've been spending the last eight months <br>
Thinking all love ever does <br>
Is break and burn and end <br>
But on a Wednesday, in a cafe <br>
I watched it begin again <br> <br>

You said you never met one girl who <br>
Had as many James Taylor records as you <br>
But I do <br>
We tell stories and you don't know why <br>
I'm coming off a little shy <br>

But on a Wednesday, in a cafe <br>
I watched it begin again <br> <br>

And we walked down the block, to my car <br>
And I almost brought him up <br>
But you start to talk about the movies <br>
That your family watches every single Christmas <br>
And I want to talk about that <br>
And for the first time <br>
What's past is past <br> <br>

'Cause you throw your head back laughing <br>
Like a little kid <br>
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny <br>
'Cause he never did <br>
And I've been spending the last eight months <br>

You should've been there <br>
Should've burst through the door <br>
With that: Baby, I'm right here, smile <br>
And it would've felt like <br>
A million little shining stars had just aligned <br>
And I would've been so happy <br> <br>

Christmas lights glisten <br>
I've got my eye on the door <br>
Just waiting for you to walk in <br>
But the time is just ticking <br>
People ask me how I've been <br>
As I comb back through my memory <br>
How you said you'd be here <br>
You said you'd be here <br> <br>

And it was like slow motion <br>
Standing there in my party dress <br>
In red lipstick <br>
With no one to impress <br>
And they're all laughing <br>
As I'm looking around the room <br>
But there was one thing missing <br>
And that was the moment I knew <br> <br>

And the hours pass by <br>
Now I just want to be alone <br>
But your close friends always seem to know <br>
When there's something really wrong <br>
So they follow me down the hall <br>
And there in the bathroom <br>
I try not to fall apart <br>
And the sinking feeling starts <br>
As I say hopelessly: He said he'd be here <br> <br>

And it was like slow motion <br>
Standing there in my party dress <br>
In red lipstick <br>
With no one to impress <br>
And they're all laughing <br>
And asking me about you <br>
But there was one thing missing <br>
And that was the moment I knew <br> <br>

What do you say <br>
When tears are streaming down your face <br>
In front of everyone you know? <br>
And what do you do <br>
When the one who means the most to you <br>
Is the one who didn't show? <br> <br>

You should've been here <br>
And I would've been so happy <br> <br>

And it was like slow motion <br>
Standing there in my party dress <br>
In red lipstick <br>
With no one to impress <br>
And they're all standing around me, singing <br>
"Happy Birthday to You" <br>
But there was one thing missing <br>
And that was the moment I knew <br> <br>

Ooh, I knew <br> <br>

You called me later <br>
And said: I'm sorry, I didn't make it <br>
And I said: I'm sorry too <br>
And that was the moment I knew

You said it in a simple way <br>
4 am, the second day <br>
How strange that I don't know you at all <br>
We stumbled through the long goodbye <br>
One last kiss, then catch your flight <br>
Right when I was just about to fall <br> <br>

I told myself: Don't get attached <br>
But in my mind I play it back <br>
Spinning faster than the plane that took you <br> <br>

And this is when the feeling sinks in <br>
I don't want to miss you like this <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br>
I guess you're in New York today <br>
I don't want to need you this way <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br> <br>

The delicate beginning rush <br>
The feeling you can know so much <br>
Without knowing anything at all <br>
And now that I can put this down <br>
If I had known what I know now <br>
I never would've played so nonchalance <br> <br>

Taxi cabs and busy streets <br>
That never bring you back to me <br>
I can't help but wish you took me with you <br> <br>

And this is when the feeling sinks in <br>
I don't want to miss you like this <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br>
I guess you're in London today <br>
And I don't want to need you this way <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br> <br>

This is falling in love in the cruelest way <br>
This is falling for you and you are worlds away <br>

In New York, be here <br>
But you're in London and I break down <br>
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around <br> <br>

This is when the feeling sinks in <br>
I don't want to miss you like this <br>
Come back, be here <br>
Come back, be here <br>
I guess you're in New York today <br>
And I don't want to need you this way <br>

I don't even know her <br>

To do what's upstanding and right <br>
It's kinda like a code, yeah <br>
And you've been getting closer and closer <br>
And crossing so many lines <br> <br>

And it would be a fine proposition <br>
If I was a stupid girl <br>
But, honey, I am no one's exception <br>
This I have previously learned <br> <br>

So, don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br>
Uh-uh, don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>

I just want to make sure <br>
You understand perfectly <br>
You're the kind of man who makes me sad <br>
While she waits up <br>
You chase down the newest thing <br>
And take for granted what you have <br> <br>

And it would be a fine proposition <br>
If I was a stupid girl <br>
And, yeah, I might go with it <br>
If I hadn't once been just like her <br> <br>

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br>
Uh-uh, don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br>
I see you turn off your phone <br>
And now you've got me alone <br>
And I say, don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br> <br>

Call a cab, lose my number <br>
You're about to lose your girl <br>
Call a cab, lose my number <br>
Let's consider this lesson learned <br> <br>

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br>
Uh-uh, don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>
And everybody knows that, everybody knows... <br>
I want to see you pick up your phone <br>
And tell her you're coming home <br>
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br> <br>

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home <br>
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that <br>
It would be a fine proposition <br>
If I hadn't once been just like her
